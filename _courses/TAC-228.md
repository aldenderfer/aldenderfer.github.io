    <ul>
        <li>TAC 228 focuses on the end-to-end process of developing CNC-fabricated objects - specifically in the realm of 3D printing - from initial concept to functional prototype.</li>
        <li>Students work individually on a a project per week that which will be modelled and then 3D printed.</li>
        <li>Emphasis is placed on practical skills in 3D modelling, and FFF printer fabrication, and assembly considerations.</li>
