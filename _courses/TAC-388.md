    <ul>
        <li>TAC-388 focuses on the end-to-end process of developing connected devices, from initial concept to functional prototype.</li>
        <li>Students work either in teams or individually on a semester-long project to create a smart device that addresses a real-world problem.</li>
        <li>Emphasis is placed on practical skills in hardware and software integration, user-centered design, and iterative development.</li>
        <li>The course is organized around a series of milestones, including ideation and proposal, design, prototyping (fabrication, assembly, and testing), and final MVP.</li>
